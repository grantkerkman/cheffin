    "## 1. Activate the yeast\n",
    "In a small bowl, mix warm water (~ 110 deg F) and sugar/honey, then sprinkle the yeast over it. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until foamy. If it doesn’t foam, your yeast might be dead—start over with fresh yeast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Mix the dough\n",
    "In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and oil/butter (if using). Stir until it forms a shaggy dough.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Knead\n",
    "Dump the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, but don’t overdo it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. First rise\n",
    "Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Shape\n",
    "Punch down the dough, shape it into a loaf, and place it in a greased loaf pan (or shape it into a round and place it on a baking sheet).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Second rise\n",
    "Cover and let it rise again for about 30-45 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Bake\n",
    "Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden brown. The bread should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Cool\n",
    "Let it cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing, or you’ll squish it.\n",
